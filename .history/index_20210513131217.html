                <h4>Step-by-Step Guide to Appealing a Ticket:</h4>
                 <p>Parking tickets can be contested by mail or in person. The parking ticket you received has the address of where to send the appeal.</p>
						 <p><span class="greentext"> Step 1 </span>Gather evidence if you plan to appeal: if possible, act as soon as possible to truly reflect the situation when you got your ticket. E.g. 
						 Snap any unclear signs, bay markings or lines, and areas where you believe they should be.</p>
						 <p><span class="greentext"> Step 2 </span>Make an informal challenge: If you've found a ticket on your car, it's worth first making an informal challenge – but do it within 14 days</p>
						 <p><span class="greentext"> Step 3 </span>Make a formal appeal: Make sure to send the letter <a href="https://parkingaccess.com/blog/dispute-parking-tickets" target="_blank">before the appeal cutoff time </a>to avoid late fees and penalties</p>
						 <p><span class="greentext"> Step 4 </span> Attach Evidence to the Letter: This might include photos of the scene of the incident, signed witness statements, a receipt for vehicle repairs or towed 
						 services if your vehicle was disabled when you received the ticket, etc (Greg,2021)</p>
						 <p><span class="greentext"> Step 5 </span> Call to Confirm: Make sure to call the office if don't get response in a few days.</p>
						 <p><span class="greentext"> Step 6 </span> Attend the Hearing: Make sure to bring copies of the evidence you sent and speak clearly to the hearing officer.</p>
						 <p><span class="greentext"> Step 7 </span> What’s the next step? If an internal review is unsuccessful then you will need to determine whether to <a href="https://legalvision.com.au/5-steps-to-contesting-a-parking-ticket/" target="_blank">accept 
						 the parking ticket and pay it or take the matter to court</a> (McKnight, 2017)</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Fill out <a href="https://www.savethestudent.org/save-money/how-to-appeal-a-parking-ticket.html" target="_blank">Notice of Appeal form </a>, attaching all your evidence (the adjudicator won't have seen any of your previous appeals), and you 
								can still write a separate letter if the form doesn't give you enough space to explain your appeal (Allingham, 2020)</li>
								<li>Unlike a court hearing, appealing to the independent adjudicator is also free</li>
								<li>Although you have the option of a personal hearing to fight your corner, you can just as easily complete the process by phone, email or post</li>
								<li>Always address adjudicator with the correct salutation in case you present the case in person or phone call, such as "your honor" </li>
